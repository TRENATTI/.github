Trenati is a game studio that pioneers its projects on various gaming platforms. Founded from the ashes of Alpha Authority's community on Roblox, a new direction was needed to continue the community and soforthe this studio exists.

This github organization stores a lot of code we may pull into our services and servers for our usage. In efforts to remain transparent with public, it is preferred that Trenati's technology remains publicly available and reviewable by anyone. As part of Trenati's on-going development for its projects, not every system here will be easily reviewable, but reviewable nevertheless for those wishing to do so.
